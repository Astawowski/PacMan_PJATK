# PacMan_PJATK
My own game created in Java as an university project during 2nd semester PJATK studies.

This game is basically a recreation of the original PacMan game from 80'.
Every algorithm here was created by me, I was not using any source code from the original game.

Game involves 5 different maps, 4 enemies with AI written by me. There is also a functionality of a Ranking Table. You can save your score after the game and see what place have you took.

----Instalation

To run the game, download the 'PacMan.jar' and 'Data.zip' files. Unpack 'Data.zip' and place the newly unpacked 'Data' directory next to 'PacMan.jar' file.  Launch by running 'java -jar PacMan.jar' command.
Source code files are embedded in 'PacMan.jar' file and you can view them by unpacking the .jar package using some dedicated program.
